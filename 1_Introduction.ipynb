For example - in realestate appraiser case, price of building is dependent variabeles and physical characteristics of building along with taxe-rate is considered as independent/explanatory variables. \n",

        "1.   **Precisely define your problem statement** - Defining the problem statement is the first and perhaps the most important step in the model development process. A misformulated question lead to incorrect solution. For example, if we intend to find \"Are women paid less than equally qualified men?\" then it has to be worded like that. If we define the same as \"Are women more qualified than eaully paid men\" will result in wrong model. \n",
        "2.   **Selection of potentially relevant variables** - Create a list of explanatory variables that can explain response variable. Literature review and expert advice can be of great help here.  \n",
        "3.   **Data collection** - Data can be either experimental or non-expeimental. In experimental data, we have control on the process of data generation but that is not the case in non-experimental data. Conventionally, number of observations in the data is represented by $n$ and $i^{th}$ observation of $j^{th}$ variable is represented by $x_{i,j}$. Following table can help us understand this representation - \n",

Most popular parameter estimation method is *least sqaure method*. But sometimes assumptions for least square is not satisfied, then we can use other methods like *maximum likelihood estimator*. \n",
        "6.   **Model fitting** -  Once the method for estimating the parameter is done in step 5, we go on to estimate the $\\beta_s$ of the population regression function mentioned in step 4.
